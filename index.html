<h1><a href="index.html">Marginal Utility</a></h1>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">In economics, <strong>utility</strong> is the satisfaction or benefit derived <strong>by consuming a product</strong>; thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility" target="_blank" title="marginal utility"><strong><u>the marginal utility</u></strong></a> of a good or service is <strong>the change in the utility</strong> from an increase in the consumption of that good or service.</p>
<p style="margin-top:20px;">In the context of <strong>cardinal utility</strong>, economists sometimes speak of a law of diminishing marginal utility, meaning that the first unit of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts. Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as <strong>diminishing marginal utility</strong>. Mathematically:</p>
